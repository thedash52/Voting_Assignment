### What is this repository for? ###

This was the last assignment for my Bachelor of Information Communication Technology. We were asked to create a Universal Windows application with backend for collecting voting data.  
Verson 1.0

### How to use the App? ###

You can find the code for the frontend application in the frontend folder while the dist folder contains the install files.  

First Name: Bob  
Last Name: Smith  
Date of Birth: 10 Aug 1993  
Electoral ID: ABC123456  

At this point you are not able to see the whole application as register user is not currently a part of the application.  

The backend can be accessed from [votingbackend.azurewebsites.net](http://votingbackend.azurewebsites.net). The code is in the backend folder.
